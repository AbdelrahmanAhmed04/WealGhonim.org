            <li class="reveal">On <strong>9 February,</strong> Ghonim addressed the crowds in <strong>Tahrir Square,</strong> telling the protesters: <em>"This is not the time for individuals, or parties, or movements. It's a time for all of us to say just one thing: Egypt above all."</em></li>

                <p class="quoted-paragraph"><em>"Our revolution is like Wikipedia, okay? Everyone is contributing content, [but] you don't know the names of the people contributing the content. This is exactly what happened. Revolution 2.0 in Egypt was exactly the same. Everyone contributing small pieces, bits and pieces. We drew this whole picture of a revolution.
